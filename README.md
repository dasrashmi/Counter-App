# Counter-App
Counters are a simple yet important feature that can be found in various web applications, including e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and online games. Counters can be used to track the number of likes, shares, or clicks, or to display the number of any item.

Highlights of projects:

#classList -> The classList property returns the CSS classnames of an element. The classList property returns a DOMTokenList.
#currentTarget -> The currentTarget property returns the element whose event listener triggered the event. 
The target property refers to the element whose event listener triggered the event, opposed to the target property, which returns the element that triggered the event.
